# MVEngine
Game engine made in Java.

This is a graphical game engine (aka with editor) that can be used to create 2D and (soon) 3D games in java. We will make it so you don't need to know java to code in it. Kotlin support will be added aswell. But you will also be able to create node-like scripts (like unreal blueprints) instead of coding it in java. 

Modern JRE (Java runtime environment) is almost if not just as fast as native code, since it uses JIT compilation. Therefore, speed is not really an issue with using Java over C++. We might make it in C++ later, after we are done with this. For now, I think this is adequate enough to be a good game engine.
